# stupidest, least interesting challenge of them all
- had no motivation to showacase anything
- whole time fighting if I should use any library for such easy task or should I do anything like I would do usually
- stupid pressure  "Approach this task as if you are already an employee at
                    Truecaller and this is a part of a real project." 
                        - I don't know your architecture
                    
- illogical 3 requests
